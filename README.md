Task 3 - "Iris Flower Classification"

# Objectives: 

To build a machine learning model to predict the species of Iris flower into different species based on their features.

# Dataset:

A small classic dataset from Fisher, 1936.

Attribute Type:Real

Instances:150

Attributes:4

The iris dataset contains three classes of flowers, Versicolor, Setosa, Virginica, and each class contains 4 features, ‘Sepal length’, ‘Sepal width’, ‘Petal length’, ‘Petal width’.

Attribute Information:
    
1.sepal length in cm
2.sepal width in cm
3.petal length in cm
4.petal width in cm
5.class: 
-- Iris Setosa
-- Iris Versicolour
-- Iris Virginica

# Steps:
Data pre-processing, Data Visualization and Model Training and Model Prediction are the key fundamentals of this task.

1. Exploratory Data Analysis: I thoroughly analyzed the Iris flower dataset, gaining insights into the distinctive features that set each species apart.
  
2. Data Preprocessing: Ensuring data quality, I performed preprocessing tasks, including handling missing values, Label encoding, feature scaling, and data partitioning for training and testing purposes.
  
3. Model building: I have Used K-Nearest Neighbours(KNN) algorithm  on the iris dataset to predict the species of iris flower given the sepal and petal dimensions.
   
4. Prediction and Evaluation: I have created a new data frame and model is tested. Accuracy Score of the model is 97%.
