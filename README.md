# Task 1: House Price prediction

# Objectives:

To develope a machine learning model using linear regression to predict house prices.

# Dataset:

This data gives different sales prices with respect to type of houses in USA.

This data frame contains the following columns:

Input variables

1 -Avg. Area Income

2 - Avg. Area House Age

3 -Avg. Area Number of Rooms

4 - Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms

5 - Address

Output variable :

6 - Area Population

# Steps:

Data pre-processing, Data cleaning, Data Visualization and Model Training and Model Prediction are the key fundamentals of this task.

1. Exploratory Data Analysis: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) helpedto gain insights into the dataset. Visualizations helped to understand the distribution of different parameters and identify any outliers or correlations.
  
2. Data Preprocessing: Ensuring data quality, I performed preprocessing tasks, including checking missing values,  feature scaling, and data partitioning for training and testing purposes.
  
3. Model building: I have Used Linear Regression algorithm  to predict the price of the houses. .
   
4. Prediction and Evaluation: The model is tested. R2 score  of the model is 91%.
