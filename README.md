# Task 1: House Price prediction

# Objectives:

To develope a machine learning model using linear regression to predict house prices.

# Dataset:

This data gives different sales prices with respect to type of houses in USA.

This data frame contains the following columns:

Input variables

1 -Avg. Area Income

2 - Avg. Area House Age

3 -Avg. Area Number of Rooms

4 - Avg. Area Number of Bedrooms

5 - Address

Output variable :

6 - Area Population

# Steps:

Data pre-processing, Data cleaning, Data Visualization and Model Training and Predictions are the key fundamentals of this task.

1. Exploratory Data Analysis: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) helpedto gain insights into the dataset. Visualizations helped to understand the distribution of different parameters and identify any outliers or correlations.
  
2. Data Preprocessing: Ensuring data quality, I performed preprocessing tasks, including checking missing values,  feature scaling, and data partitioning for training and testing purposes.
  
3. Model building: I have Used Linear Regression algorithm  to predict the price of the houses. .
   
4. Prediction and Evaluation: The model is tested. R2 score  of the model is 91%.

The iris dataset contains three classes of flowers, Versicolor, Setosa, Virginica, and each class contains 4 features, ‘Sepal length’, ‘Sepal width’, ‘Petal length’, ‘Petal width’.

Attribute Information:
    
1.sepal length in cm
2.sepal width in cm
3.petal length in cm
4.petal width in cm
5.class: 
-- Iris Setosa
-- Iris Versicolour
-- Iris Virginica

# Steps:
Data pre-processing, Data Visualization and Model Training and  Predictions are the key fundamentals of this task.

1. Exploratory Data Analysis: I thoroughly analyzed the Iris flower dataset, gaining insights into the distinctive features that set each species apart.
  
2. Data Preprocessing: Ensuring data quality, I performed preprocessing tasks, including handling missing values, Label encoding, feature scaling, and data partitioning for training and testing purposes.
  
3. Model building: I have Used K-Nearest Neighbours(KNN) algorithm  on the iris dataset to predict the species of iris flower given the sepal and petal dimensions.
   
4. Prediction and Evaluation: I have created a new data frame and model is tested. Accuracy Score of the model is 97%.
